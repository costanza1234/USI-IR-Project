# INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PROJECT 

## STEPS
1. Design (with justification of the design choices)
2. Search engine implementation
    2.1 Build collections: crawl multiple sources (websites), similar in content and topic to the website suggested
3. Search interface implementation:
    3.1 For searching, browsing, and presentation of the data to the user
4. Additional features:
    4.1 Filtering: in addition to being able to search by title, an user should be able to filter the results based on at least 3 relevant attributes for your project.
    4.2 User Relevance Feedback: after presenting the search results to a user, the user may provide a positive or negative feedback on the results (i.e. mark relevant and irrelevant documents). Based on this feedback the search results have to be updated and presented again.
    4.3 TBD
5. Evaluation (user evaluation):
    Three students will act as test users of your system and help you in evaluating your system from the point of view of the user experience. System evaluation (i.e. recall and precision) is not required.

## Submition
1. One-page progress report (27 Nov)
2. Project report (16 Dic):
• A concise explanation (max 10 pages) of how you tackled the design, implementation and evaluation
• Explaindesignchoices,implementationchoices,evaluationdesign,evaluationresults
• Just imagine this is a report for a client who does not know much about IR, but
wants to know what you are delivering him/her The code:
3. Code (16 Dic)
4. Slides (?) (16 Dic)
