# INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PROJECT 

## STEPS
1. Design (with justification of the design choices)
2. Search engine implementation
3. Search interface implementation
4. Evaluation (user evaluation)

## Design

### Main Features

- **Visual Identity**: keep visual identity, rarely canches in logo
- **Search Statistics**: always visualized in a consistent manner under the navigation bar
- **Input/Query**: always visible on top of the page, large width to encourage formulation of longer queries, accept spoken commands
- **Spell-Check**: 2 types of mistakes (conceptual and slip-of-fingers). use deep neural nets that model and learn.
- **Auto-Complete**: look for common queries that match what the user is typing, check also language + location + trending topics + past searches

### Good Practice

- use top/top-left aligned search box with simple icons and contrasting clickable area.
- use Auto-Suggestion to reduce data-input time
- spell check
- provide adcanced search option

### Do NOT!

- hide the search box
- make search field too short
- make search button too small
- overload search with advanced functionalities
