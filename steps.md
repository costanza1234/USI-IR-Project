# INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PROJECT 

## Goal: Implement a working prototype of an information retrieval system for a specific task and user needs. You need to build a system that gathers a large collection of samples associated with the topic and enable the search over this collection. To build the collections, you need to crawl multiple sources (websites), similar in content and topic to the website suggested.
The system must provide an interface for searching, browsing, and presentation of the data to the user.

### Step 1. Design

Design the interface. Justify the design choices

#### Main Features

- **Visual Identity**: keep visual identity, rarely canches in logo
- **Search Statistics**: always visualized in a consistent manner under the navigation bar
- **Input/Query**: always visible on top of the page, large width to encourage formulation of longer queries, accept spoken commands
- **Spell-Check**: 2 types of mistakes (conceptual and slip-of-fingers). use deep neural nets that model and learn.
- **Auto-Complete**: look for common queries that match what the user is typing, check also language + location + trending topics + past searches

#### Good Practice

- use top/top-left aligned search box with simple icons and contrasting clickable area.
- use Auto-Suggestion to reduce data-input time
- spell check
- provide adcanced search option

#### Do NOT!

- hide the search box
- make search field too short
- make search button too small
- overload search with advanced functionalities

### Step 2. Search engine implementation

#### Build collections

crawl multiple sources (websites), similar in content and topic to the website suggested

### Step 3. Search interface implementation

For searching, browsing, and presentation of the data to the user

### Step 4. Additional Features

1. **filtering**: in addition to being able to search by title, an user should be able to filter the results based on at least 3 relevant attributes for your project.
2. **User Relevance Feedback**: after presenting the search results to a user, the user may provide a positive or negative feedback on the results (i.e. mark relevant and irrelevant documents). Based on this feedback the search results have to be updated and presented again.
3. **Results snippets**: present result snippets of each retrieved result (maximum 2-3 lines) in a kind of “Google style”, with query terms highlighted.

### Step 5. Evaluation
Three students will act as test users of your system and help you in evaluating your system from the point of view of the user experience. System evaluation (i.e. recall and precision) is not required.
