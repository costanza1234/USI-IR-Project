## Roles

### **General Milestones**

1. **Progress Report (27 Nov):**
   - Interface design and features in progress (Person 1).
   - Data collection and backend search engine progress (Person 2).
   - Additional features plan (filtering, feedback, snippets) and evaluation strategy (Person 3).

2. **Final Report and Code (16 Dec)**

### **Person 1: Design and Interface**

#### **Tasks and Deadlines**

1. **27 Nov:**
   - Create a draft mockup of the user interface, highlighting key design choices (e.g., search box placement, visual identity, auto-complete).
   - Justify the interface design and explain how it aligns with user-friendly principles.
   - Provide initial steps for implementing the interface (e.g., choice of framework, basic structure setup).

2. **15 Dec:**
   - Implement a fully functional UI with:
     - A search box (top-left aligned, large width, with spell-check and auto-complete integration).
     - Placeholder components for search statistics and advanced search options.
   - Integrate frontend with backend API (Person 2).
   - Test and finalize frontend, ensuring proper display of filtering, feedback, and snippets (Person 3).

3. **16 Dec:**
   - Document the design choices and implementation process for the interface.
   - Explain challenges faced and solutions implemented during the design phase.

### **Person 2: Data Collection and Search Engine**

#### **Tasks and Deadlines**

1. **27 Nov:**
   - Outline the strategy for crawling websites (e.g., selected tools like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy).
   - Provide preliminary results or describe the format of collected data.
   - Explain the plan for indexing and building the search engine using Elasticsearch or similar.

2. **15 Dec:**
   - Complete data collection and structure the dataset.
   - Build the search engine, ensuring support for:
     - Full-text search.
     - Spell-check and auto-suggestions (coordinate with Person 1).
     - Filtering by relevant attributes (coordinate with Person 3).
   - Create API endpoints for frontend integration.

3. **16 Dec:**
   - Document data collection methods, challenges, and final dataset details.
   - Explain the implementation of the search engine and backend integration.

### **Person 3: Additional Features and Evaluation**

#### **Tasks and Deadlines**

1. **27 Nov:**
   - Outline the plan for filtering, user feedback, and snippet features.
   - Describe the evaluation strategy (e.g., user feedback process, metrics for user experience).
   - Include a basic framework for how user feedback will influence search results.

2. **15 Dec:**
   - Implement filtering logic and integrate it into the search engine (coordinate with Person 2).
   - Develop and integrate:
     - User feedback system for marking relevant/irrelevant results.
     - Result snippets highlighting query terms.
   - Plan and conduct evaluation with test users, documenting feedback and potential improvements.

3. **16 Dec:**
   - Detail the implementation of additional features and their functionality.
   - Summarize user evaluation results and how they informed system improvements.

---

### **Progress Report (27 Nov):**

Each person will contribute a paragraph or two to a single **progress report** summarizing:
1. **Current progress and initial implementations**.
2. **Challenges encountered and plans for overcoming them**.
3. **Planned next steps to meet the project goals**.

---

### **Final Deliverables (16 Dec):**

1. **Project Report:**
   - Combine sections from all three contributors:
     - Design and interface description (Person 1).
     - Data collection and search engine implementation (Person 2).
     - Additional features and evaluation (Person 3).
   - Write as a client-facing document, clearly explaining:
     - Design and implementation choices.
     - User-friendly explanations of features.
     - Evaluation results.

2. **Code**
